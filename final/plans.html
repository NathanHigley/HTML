<h1 class="head">POST-SECONDARY & CAREER PLANS</h1>
<hr />
<p>Upon graduating from high school, I plan to obtain a local job or internship
  for sustainability and work experience, preferably pertaining to software or
  hardware interaction. Along with this, I plan to attend Columbia Basin College
  to obtain a degree for a relevant technical speciality.
  <br /><br />
  Assuming I don't continue education from there, I currently plan to
  professionally engineer software as a career. I should not have to leave
  Washington or potentially even Tri-Cities, as Washington is very demanding for
  this field currently.</p>
