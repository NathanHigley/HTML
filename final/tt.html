<h1 class="head">TRI-TECH | ADVANTAGES & DISADVANTAGES</h1>
<hr />
<p>Tri-Tech as a Skills Center succeeds immensely at providing insight and
   experience for a profession. The education feels very thorough and can be
   well utilized for the future. The environment feels very preparing,
   and peers are very cooperative with the process.
   <br /><br />
   The only issues appear to be its location and integration into traditional
   high school. Many have difficulty commuting from around the area due to
   distance or other stipulations, and attendance otherwise is not always
   convenient for the schedule of the home high school.</p>
