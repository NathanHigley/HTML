<h1 class="head">SUCCESSES & CHALLENGES</h1>
<hr />
<p>I found myself very successful this year with learning and applying
   programming and design skills. Team projects ended up being very productive
   as both a manager and collaborator.
   <br /><br />
   In turn, I was challenged by communication and presence. Development for just
   about any project felt incredibly slow when direction or cooperation felt
   lacking. On top of this, my attendance was less than professionally
   acceptable, and had an adverse impact on my progress.</p>
