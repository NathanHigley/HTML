<h1 class="head">PERSONAL SATISFACTION</h1>
<hr />
<p>My most profound takeaway from this year is the environment I now am
   comfortable to work in. It felt very satisfying to be able to interpret new
   languages and troubleshoot something foreign and interesting to me at will,
   and even make something entirely unique out of it. Team projects, while not
   always entirely cooperative, were an excellent experience for understanding
   the career I plan to enter.
   <br /><br />
   Overall, the experience itself was the most satisfying to reflect on.</p>
